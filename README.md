# Technical Assignment - Mini Traffic Sim
This is my code for a recent technical assignment for a Junior Full-Stack Developer role at a software development company

## Requirements
- Develop a small app that simulates the movement of transport in a simplified manner
- It must be possible to add, start and top means of transportation
  - Every vehicle should be able to start and stop
- You can assume that a vehicle is at its full speed immediately
- Everything should be done in a way to allow easy extension later
- Some means of transportation can have extra behaviour. Provide some dummy methods to support this and to extend in the future.

## Directions
- Try to develop everything in a clean OO manner that demonstrates your knowledge of using classes, inheritance and possibly interfaces. 
- Please keep it simple!
- Try to keep to to 2-3 hours of development

### The following types of transportation must be supported:
- Car – with a speed of 50 meter / second
- Truck – with a speed of 30 meter / second
- Airplane – with a speed of 200 meter / second

## Learnings
- Strengthened my understanding of some OOP principles, as well as using classes + class extension with JS ES6
